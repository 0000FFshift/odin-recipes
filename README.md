Odin - Recipe Project

In this project, my task is to create a basic recipe website using only HTML. This site will contain an index page linking to three different recipe pages. The index will link to each recipe, and each recipe will contain a link back to the index.

## Skills utilized in this project:

- HTML boilerplate
- Adding images in different directories
- Adding relative links to pages in different directories
- Using both unordered and ordered lists
- Utilized paragraph tags to organize information
- Utilized Git to make several commits including succinct comments as I was building out the site
